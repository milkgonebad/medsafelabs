Migrating to postgresql

Need to create sequences
http://cmar.me/2011/03/03/mysql-to-postgres-id-column-sequences/

I needed to create on user to seed the sequence.  They should be deleted.
Create the sequence:

SELECT setval('users_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM users)+1);
Then add it to the table:
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN "id" set DEFAULT NEXTVAL('users_id_seq');

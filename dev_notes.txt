Migrating to postgresql

Need to create sequences
http://cmar.me/2011/03/03/mysql-to-postgres-id-column-sequences/

I needed to create on user to seed the sequence.  They should be deleted.
Create the sequence:

SELECT setval('users_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM users)+1);
Then add it to the table:
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN "id" set DEFAULT NEXTVAL('users_id_seq');


Super Admin user:
super@medsafelabs.com
P0rtland!

Test Admin user (on my laptop):
meow@test.com
12345678

Deploying:
git push staging master - staging http://medsafelabs-staging.herokuapp.com
git push heroku master - prod http://medsafelabs.herokuapp.com

heroku run rake db:migrate --remote staging
heroku run rake db:migrate --remote heroku

get logs
heroku logs --remote staging

heroku run console --remote staging

heroku restart --remote staging
